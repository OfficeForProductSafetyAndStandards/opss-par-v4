# OPSS Primary Authority Register
The Primary Authority Register (PAR) is a secure service supporting the operation of Primary Authority (PA), 
which allows businesses to receive assured and tailored advice to meet regulations through either direct or 
co-ordinated partnerships with local authorities, including fire and rescue authorities.

Local regulators can use this service to view, share or manage information on these partnerships, guiding 
enforcement work across the UK. Businesses or organisations representing them can view the details of their 
specific partnerships.
